This plug Abby's custom items made by Avery Reel, alias: abby226 is a paper plugin designed to add customized and functional items to my Minecraft server. This plugin started out as a basic one-item plugin almost a half-year ago and has grown to now feature GUIs instead of a single command per item, which for me was a headache when trying to find certain items. The plugin is still actively in development with new feature and/or modifications each release. This plugin is currently stable and optimized for Minecraft 1.20.1 

Available Commands:

/collectibles - Opens a GUI for the player of the available collectables. User can remove items from the GUI.

/oparmor - Opens a GUI of OP armor which the user can remove.
